Radical in the sense that the solutions could help millions (or billions) of people; that the audacity of the proposals makes them sound like science fiction; and that there is some real breakthrough or new approach that makes us believe these ideas could be brought to life. We meet in-person and online. \n\nWe\u2019re running two special interactive Solve for X sessions at this year\u2019s Google I/O.  After hearing short proposals from three tech pioneers, our audience will breakout into small-group brainstorming -- spending 2/3rds of the time generating \u2018yes, and\u2019 feedback (e.g. ideas for resources, funding, scaling), and 1/3rd of the time offering constructive critique (e.g. remaining questions, potential blind spots).  And then we gather to report back. \n\nJoin us! \n\nSolve for X@IO - 3:00pm-5:00pm on the afternoon of June 25th.   \nSolve for X@IO - 9:00am-11:00am on the morning of June 26th.\n\n< Solve for X is an open platform powered by Google [x] and many partners and friends >",

Today, information can be collected at a much faster rate, every minute the student is online. This session will describe how that information can be used to help students and educators improve the process, and how Google has experimented with online courses, to: (1) learn what material works and what can be improved; (2) evaluate a student's progress; and (3) inform the next generation of online courses.",

      "description": "Solve for X (www.solveforx.com) is a community of people working to accelerate progress on technology moonshots -- radical technology ideas for solving global problems. Radical in the sense that the solutions could help millions (or billions) of people; that the audacity of the proposals makes them sound like science fiction; and that there is some real breakthrough or new approach that makes us believe these ideas could be brought to life. We meet in-person and online. \n\nWe\u2019re running two special interactive Solve for X sessions at this year\u2019s Google I/O.  After hearing short proposals from three tech pioneers, our audience will breakout into small-group brainstorming -- spending 2/3rds of the time generating \u2018yes, and\u2019 feedback (e.g. ideas for resources, funding, scaling), and 1/3rd of the time offering constructive critique (e.g. remaining questions, potential blind spots).  And then we gather to report back. \n\nJoin us! \n\nSolve for X@IO - 3:00pm-5:00pm on the afternoon of June 25th.   \nSolve for X@IO - 9:00am-11:00am on the morning of June 26th.\n\n< Solve for X is an open platform powered by Google [x] and many partners and friends >",
