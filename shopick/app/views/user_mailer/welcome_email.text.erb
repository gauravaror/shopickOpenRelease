Hi <%=@user.name%>,

Meetup? Coffee? Tea?

This month, we are organizing a Coffee Session with our initial users like you at Costa in SDA Market, Hauz Khas. We promise you'll have fun! 

What are we trying to do? 

We are trying to get technology to Brick & Mortar shopping to make it more easy & interactive. 
Hence we started with displaying all the offers running at stores in Delhi NCR. This feature would help you choose where to shop! Apart from this you can upload the products that you like or have bought so that other users can discover the collection.
Our operations team is constantly running around different malls & markets to provide you with the inventory available at their stores.

Help us grow?

We'd love if you could post couple of words about our app, either on Facebook(http://on.fb.me/1PezmcQ) or Twitter(http://bit.ly/1RoIqlN)


Regards,
Mrutyunjay Hiremath
